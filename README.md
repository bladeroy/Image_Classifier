# Introduction:
Create a custom Image Classifier that will train on the fly in the browser using Tensorflow.js. First we need to load and run a popular pre-trained model called <b>MobileNet</b> for image classification in the browser. Then use a technique called <b>"Transfer learning"</b>, which bootstraps our training with the pre-trained MobileNet model and customizes it to train for your application.

# Requirements:
To complete this codelab, you will need:

<ul><li>A recent version of Chrome or another modern browser.</li>
<li>A text editor, either running locally on your machine or on the web via something like Codepen or Glitch.</li>
<li>Knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chrome DevTools (or your preferred browsers devtools).</li>
