# Introduction:
Create a custom Image Classifier that will train on the fly in the browser using Tensorflow.js. First we need to load and run a popular pre-trained model called MobileNet for image classification in the browser. Then use a technique called "transfer learning", which bootstraps our training with the pre-trained MobileNet model and customizes it to train for your application.

# Requirements:
To complete this codelab, you will need:

A recent version of Chrome or another modern browser.
A text editor, either running locally on your machine or on the web via something like Codepen or Glitch.
Knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chrome DevTools (or your preferred browsers devtools).
A high-level conceptual understanding of Neural Networks. If you need an introduction or refresher, consider watching this video by 3blue1brown or this video on Deep Learning in Javascript by Ashi Krishnan.
